# stldevs
St. Louis developer profiles

## motivations

- St. Louis developers that contribute to open source should be more visible
- St. Louis developers that are interested in certain
 languages and technologies need an easier way to find each other
- St. Louis companies need ways to view developers
 without going through recruiters that already have systems to scrape Github
- Fun!

## contributing

Pull requests are welcome! All Go files should be run through goimports
before pushing. I suggest GoSublime or IntelliJ Go plugin.
